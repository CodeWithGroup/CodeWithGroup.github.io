<p>CodeWith mentors run drop-in sessions and workshops; you can read more about the sessions below.</p>

<p>Before attending any CodeWith event, please read our <a href="code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>, which applies to all events we run. All
    attendees, speakers, and mentors must agree with this code of conduct. It helps us all to understand the 
    community&apos;s shared values and provides clear guidelines on how we should behave.</p>
