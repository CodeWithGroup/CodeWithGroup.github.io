<h1>Availability Process</h1>

        <p>
            Mentors are expected to let us know their availability to help at CodeWith events.
            To do this, we use a Google Sheet on which you can colour in the various days of
            the month to show whether you're free, possibly free, or unavailable. Each mentor
            has their own tab, so it should be relatively easy to find yours and fill it in.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recognise that your availability may change - and that's fine - but filling in
            the sheet gives the event coordinator a starting point to find mentors for events.
            You'll usually be contacted beforehand to confirm you're still available anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            A monthly reminder to fill it in, along with a link to the Sheet, will be sent out 
            in the <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com/archives/G018BBQ86PK">#admin</a> and 
            <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com/archives/G017ZSY63GS">#mentor</a> channels
            on Slack. The event coordinator will ask you to update the spreadsheet for that month, 
            and will add new months as the year moves on.
        </p>
        <p>The link will also be <i>pinned</i> to the <a
                href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com/archives/G018BBQ86PK">#admin</a> and <a
                href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com/archives/G017ZSY63GS">#mentor</a> channels
            for quick access if you need to edit your tab at any point.
