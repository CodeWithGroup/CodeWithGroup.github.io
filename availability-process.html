<h1>Availability Process</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12">
    <p>Mentors are expected to fill in their availability to help at CodeWith events. We recognise this may change but
      it gives the event coordinator a starting point to find mentors.</p>

    <p>A monthly reminder will be sent out in the <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com/archives/G018BBQ86PK">#admin</a> and <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com/archives/G017ZSY63GS">#mentor</a> channel on Slack to update the spreadsheet and add new months as the year moves on.
