                    Code Academy gives you specific problems to solve and, as you solve each one, the difficulty
                    level increases. You can learn about building websites, developing programs (in languages
                    like Python) and get an introduction to Data Analysis.

                    to jump straight in. There are about 10 lessons where you get used to the basics but before long
                    you're designing and implementing the AI for a game character.
