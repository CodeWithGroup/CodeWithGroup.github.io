<h2>Drop-in sessions</h2>
<p>
    Drop-in sessions are hosted by at least one mentor and run regularly in the evenings.
    You can get help on our <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com">Slack Workspace</a>
    or, if it's a really tricky problem, we can always jump into a Jitsi meeting with you.
</p>
<p>
    Jitsi links for regularly-scheduled sessions will be added to the web site a little
    before each drop-in event, so check back here to join via the 'Jitsi Link' button.
