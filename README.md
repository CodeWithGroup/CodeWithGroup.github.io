## Testing 

Testing is important for maintainers and contributors alike. Ensure all aspects of the site work as the did previously before submitting a pull request. 

Things to look out for when testing

* Responsive design - how does the page display on different devices, and different orientations.
* Browser support - Test your changes in a few major browsers, are there any errors?

Before pull requests are merged maintainers should test all aspects of the site. 

# Getting started with this site and Jekyll

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

Quoted from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

## Jekyll setup

Use [this guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to setup Jekyll for your operating system.

## Building the site

Open a command line in the root directory of the repository

Run `jekyll build` to build the site, this will produce a `_site` folder with the required content

>:Warning: do not edit anything in the site folder as it will not be comitted and is overwritten everytime you build the site.

To rebuild the site after a file change append `--watch` to the end of the command. 

e,g. `jekyll build --watch`

Once you have a `_site` folder open the `index.html` file inside to view the site.

## Includes

Jeykll has functionality to include files, which this site makes extensive use of. You can find the documentation for includes here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/

# Useful guides

## To add yourself to the people page

* Create a branch
* Make a copy of one of the existing bios in *pages-people* 
* Name it using the convention people-*yourname* 
* Modify to be your bio including
    * Photograph
    * Information paragraph
    * Twitter (optional)
    * Things you can help with

If you need any help, contact one of the pople who have already added themselves.

Copy the includes code `<br />
{% include_relative pages-people/people-yourname.html %}` to the bottom of people.html (ensure you update the file name)

## Sitemap
All pages not defined as a default in _config.yml are added to the sitemap

To exclude a specific page use the snippet `sitemap:false` at the top of the page

:warning: **If you are including the page in another page (using `include_relative`)**: add the page as a default in `_config.yml` otherwise the `sitemap:false` is displayed as HTML on the page.

### Example default to add to `_config.yml`
```yml
-
  scope:
    path: 'pages-people/*'
  values:
    sitemap: false
```

All files in `_include` are excluded from the sitemap automatically
## Adding a page to the typed suffix functionality

* Add a key to the Jekyll build options at the top of the page

e.g. 

```
suffixes:
    - Databases,
    - Docker,
    - Git,
    - SQL,
    - Kubernetes,
    - Us
```
