                    Alexander Kallaway spent a year and a half learning to code and had many ups and downs along the
                    way. He felt his experience would be useful to people and so set up #100DaysOfCode, challenging
                    people to code for an hour a day. The challenge now has a small army of committed subscribers who
                    share their projects, experiences and progress daily.

                    In 2015 <a href="http://was.tl/" target="_blank">Eric Wastl</a>, presumably unsatisfied with the
                    singular chocolate found behind each door of his Advent calendar, decided to create a series of
                    small programming puzzles instead. It's incredible fun to follow, and he has repeated the challenge
                    each year so there are now challenges for
                    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2015" target="_blank">2015</a>,
                    <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016" target="_blank">2016</a> and

                    language and use a variety of skills.

                    Interested in what life was like when computers were programmed using 4-letter code words and
                    hexadecimal numbers? Well, wonder no more. Box-256 is a computer game that challenges you to draw
                    shapes using the kind of limited instruction set last seen in the 1960s. Challenging and
                    interesting, even for the most prolific coder.

                    The principle behind Code Wars is that you achieve mastery through challenge, and you can improve
                    your skills by training with others. The exercises are real code challenges and can be done in any
                    of 20 different languages. Users are encouraged to share and discuss their answers, meaning there's
                    always someone to ask and always some way to learn.

                    that can be completed in any programming language. Three challenges are put up every week which
                    increase in difficulty, starting with an easy puzzle Monday, intermediate puzzle Wednesday and a
                    hard puzzle on a Friday.

                    Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain
                    live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jupyter allows you to write and test your code into the browser without the need to install any
                    software on your PC. It supports several languages including Python, Julia, R, C++, Ruby.
