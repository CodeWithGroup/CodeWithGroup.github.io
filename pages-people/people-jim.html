                    Jim's first computer was a Commodore 64 he inherited from his Dad at age 11. Since he dropped out of
                    a Microelectronic engineering degree when he was 20, he's been a taxi controller, Tarot reader, and
                    for the last 14+ years, a developer. He's written code for Greenpeace, banks, and mobile messaging
                    amongst others. Jim currently writes software for a 6th form college in Manchester.

                    When he's not rolling his eyes at teachers, Jim also runs a couple of CoderDojo kids coding clubs,
                    helps out at hackathons and spends a ludicrous amount of time in the cinema. Jim also helps run a
                    local beer festival and can be heard uttering phrases such as "malt backbone" and "resinous
                    freshness".
