          Marie discovered coding during her Physics studies and immediately
          fell in love with it. She received a scholarship for Women and
          Minorities to attend a software development bootcamp in Manchester.
          After graduating, she taught Python to kids and teenagers during
          week-long camps and is now working as a Full Stack Developer in a
          UK-based startup.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her spare time, she volunteers on open source projects and teaches
          coding to adults. She enjoys doing sports a lot (particularly yoga),
          going for long walks in the countryside, reading and learning all kinds of
          new things. She has recently taken up boxing and gets hit in the face
          a lot, but still thinks it's fun!
