          My journey into coding began during my time as a support worker. In my
          spare time, I was an avid gamer, which led me to ask the pivotal
          question: "How do I program this?" From that moment, I fully committed
          to teaching myself how to code. This passion ultimately led me to
          graduate from the Northcoders bootcamp. Now, six years later, I'm
          still deeply immersed in coding and continue to love every moment of
          it.

          When I'm not coding, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of board
          games and card games. I'm an active participant in the local gaming
          community and often attend events where I can connect with others who
          share this passion. Whether it's strategizing over a complex board
          game or enjoying the quick thinking required in a card game, I find
          these activities both relaxing and intellectually stimulating. You can
          often find me at local events, engaging with fellow enthusiasts and
          exploring new games.
