    Drew has been coding since he was 7 years old and has worked in the healthcare, education, finance
    and gaming industries. After qualifying as a physics teacher in 2011, he taught for three years before
    returning to software development and now works as a senior developer and technical lead for a
    consultancy in 'tech for good'. Drew specialises in back end and enterprise development, but knows
    enough about front end development to get stuff done.

    Drew loves science and technology and has studied both Physics and Computer Science (with Artificial
    Intelligence). Outside of work he is learning Esperanto, plays piano, tuba, and guitar, and is a BSAC 
    scuba diving instructor. He also plays PC games when he has time and especially enjoys Elite Dangerous
    in VR.

    Drew loves to share his experiences and will talk about anything with anyone.
