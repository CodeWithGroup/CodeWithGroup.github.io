    Nathan's journey into coding began during his time as a support worker. He is an
    avid gamer, which led him to ask the pivotal question: "How do I program this?"
    From that moment, Nathan fully committed to teaching himself how to code. This passion
    ultimately led him to graduate from the Northcoders bootcamp. Now, six years later,
    he's still deeply immersed in coding and continues to love every moment of it.

    When he's not coding, Nathan enjoys playing board games and card games. He is an active
    participant in the local gaming community and often attends events where he can connect
    with others who share his passion. Whether it's strategizing over a complex board game
    or enjoying the quick thinking required in a card game, Nathan finds these activities
    both relaxing and intellectually stimulating.

    You can often find Nathan at local events, engaging with fellow enthusiasts and exploring
    new games.
