    My journey into coding began during my time as a support worker. In my spare time, 
    I was an avid gamer, which led me to ask the pivotal question: 
    "How do I program this?" From that moment, I fully committed to teaching myself how to code. 
    This passion ultimately led me to graduate from the Northcoders bootcamp. Now, six years later, 
    I'm still deeply immersed in coding and continue to love every moment of it.

    When I'm not coding, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of board games and card games. 
    I'm an active participant in the local gaming community and often attend events where 
    I can connect with others who share this passion. Whether it's strategizing over a complex 
    board game or enjoying the quick thinking required in a card game, 
    I find these activities both relaxing and intellectually stimulating. 
    You can often find me at local events, engaging with fellow enthusiasts and exploring new games.
