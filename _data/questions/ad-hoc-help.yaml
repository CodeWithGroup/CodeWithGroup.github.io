                CodeWith isn't just a series of events, it's a community of people who do their best to help each other.
                If you visit our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codewithpeople.slack.com\">Slack workspace</a>
                or our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/jKFXkTd\">Discord server</a> there'll usually be
                someone there. Most of the time they'll be able to help, or will at least know who to ask for an answer, 
                but if not then at least you have some people you can talk to about the problem to try to find a way forward.
            </p>"
