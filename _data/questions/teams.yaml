question: "I want to work on a project with other people. Can you support us?"
answer: "<p>
    Definitely. We'll give your team a private channel on our Discord Server,
    a private channel/room on our Discord server, and set up a shared folder for
    you in our Google Drive account. You also get all the help that other members
    get, including mentoring and conversations with our more experienced developers.
