question: "Why do you have an equity officer and not an equality officer?"
answer: "            <div class=\"row\">
              <div class=\"col-md-6 text-center\">
                  <img class=\"faq\" src=\"/images/equality.png\">
              </div>
              <div class=\"col-md-6 text-center\">
                  <img class=\"faq\" src=\"/images/equity.png\">
              </div>
          </div>
          <p>
              <br />
              Equality is where everyone is supported equally, and has the same access to support, whereas
              equity is where people have the right support to get them to the same level as others even
              when they start from a less advantageous position. We realise that some people are going to need more
              help than others - for all sorts of reasons - and we wanted to make that clear from the outset.
