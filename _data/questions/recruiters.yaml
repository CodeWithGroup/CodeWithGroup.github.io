question: "I'm a recruiter. Can I come and talk to your attendees?"
answer: "            <p>
                We're not against it, as long as it's done considerately. We have a #jobs channel in our 
                <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codewithpeople.slack.com\">Slack workspace</a> where recruiters can
                post about jobs, employment opportunities and so on, but any discussions with attendees on those topics
                outside of that channel must be done by explicit agreement of the attendee(s) involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                The committee has talked about hosting an event specifically for recruiters, but the finer points still
                need to be agreed. If you would like to be contacted regarding this, please email us at
                <a href=\"mailto:contact@codewith.org.uk?subject=Recruiter Event\">contact@codewith.org.uk</a>.
              </p>"
