question: "I've spotted a problem/something missing on the website. Can I fix it myself?"
answer: "            <p>
                Yes! Our website is built from
                <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeWithGroup/CodeWithGroup.github.io\">this GitHub repository</a>
                and is yours to edit if you see a problem or want to make any additions. There are plenty of
                instructions on the README page, so have a read through that and start editing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've never used GitHub before and want someone to show you how it works, put a message in
                the Discord Server and someone should pick it up. There are also slides for a GitHub workshop 
                available, so you could ask about those too.
            </p>"
