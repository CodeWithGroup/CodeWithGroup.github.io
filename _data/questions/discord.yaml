question: "I've signed up for one of your online events, how do I join it?"
answer: "<p>
  We use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.com\">Discord</a> for our online events, you can join the server
  using this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/jKFXkTd\">invite link</a>. We recommend using the app to attend
    our workshops as some attendees have reported issues with the web app and watching screen shares.

    Once you have joined the server, check your email before the event which will tell you which channel to join. Most
    of our events start at the Main Stage channel.
