question: "How do I become a mentor/event organiser?"
answer: "            <p>
                First of all, let someone know you're interested. Have a chat with one of the existing mentors or
                someone on the committee so that we can get an idea of what you want to achieve and what support you
                need.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you're ready to begin mentoring, complete the 
                <a href=\"!SITE_URL!/mentor-application\">mentor application form</a>. From there we'll be able to
                add you into the appropriate Slack channels, give you a folder of your own in our Google Drive, show
                you how to set up events, and so on.
              </p>"
