<h2>Huddles</h2>
<p>
    Huddles are basically group conversations with a set topic. They can be formally hosted or chaired by someone who
    makes sure everyone will have a voice, but can also just be a brief chat to find out more about a subject. If you're
    interested in setting up a huddle, or finding some people to talk to about a topic, let us know in our
    <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com">Slack workspace</a>. The Discord server is always open!
