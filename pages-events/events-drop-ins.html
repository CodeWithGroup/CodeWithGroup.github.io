<h2>Drop-in sessions</h2>
<p>
    Drop-in sessions are run from our Slack workspace. We pick a time and make sure helpers and mentors are online,
    and invite people to come and ask us for help with anything at all. They run fairly regularly on weekday evenings,
    and occasionally even start without being scheduled! Discussions can be done through written messages, voice, or
    even over a video call. Sign in to our <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com">Slack workspace</a> to find out
    more.
</p>
<p>
    Jitsi links for regularly-scheduled sessions will be added to the web site a little before each drop-in event, but
    we have a permanent Jitsi room set up at <a href="https://join.codewith.org.uk">https://join.codewith.org.uk</a>.
    You can also click the 'Jitsi Link' buttons below.
