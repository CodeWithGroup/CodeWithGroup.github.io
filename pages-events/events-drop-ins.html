<h2>Drop-in Sessions</h2>
<p>
    Drop-in sessions are run from our Slack workspace. We pick a time and make sure helpers and mentors are online,
    and invite people to come and ask us for help with anything at all. They run fairly regularly on weekday evenings,
    and occasionally even start without being scheduled! Discussions can be done through written messages, voice, or
    even over a video call. Sign in to our <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com">Slack workspace</a> to find out
    more.
</p>
<p>
    We either use Jitsi or Discord for our regularly-scheduled sessions. Invitation links will be added to the Slack
    group and to the event ticket a little before each drop-in event. We also have a permanent Jitsi room set up at
    <a href="https://join.codewith.org.uk">https://join.codewith.org.uk</a> which you can join to ask questions
    even when there's no event running.
