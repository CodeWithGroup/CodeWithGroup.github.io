<h2>Drop-in Sessions</h2>
<p>
    Drop-in sessions are for people to come and chat, ask questions, or get help with anything at all. We make
    sure helpers and mentors are available, and every session is different. The sessions run fairly regularly
    - typically on the first Monday of each month - but occasionally even start without being scheduled! 
    Discussions can be done through written messages, voice, or over a video call. Sign in to our 
    <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com">Slack workspace</a> and ask to find out more.

<p>
    We generally use Discord as our gathering space for online sessions, and Code Computerlove in Manchester
    for our in-person meetups (though we're hoping to get more venues as time goes on). Invitation links will
    be added to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/codewith-30834204055">Eventbrite</a> and
    <a href="https://www.meetup.com/codewith/">Meetup</a> and reminders will go out on Slack 15 minutes
    before the online events.
