<h2>Scheduled Workshops</h2>
<p>
    Workshops are more structured than drop-ins and huddles, and usually take the form of hands-on workshops,
    demonstrations, or even lectures (though we try to avoid the latter). Most of the time they will involve a host
    presenting slides or working through a problem on-screen, answering people's questions as they go.

    If there's a workshop you'd really like us to run - say on a topic you're new to, or something you're really
    interested in - then sign in to our <a href="https://codewithpeople.slack.com">Slack workspace</a> and post in
    the #event-ideas channel. That way we can discuss it with you and make sure you get the most out of it.
