<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
    CodeWith is a new community for adults wanting to learn more about the world of computers.
</p>
<p>
    We're in the process of putting together a programme of events for people who want to learn to code or get into
    computing. Have a look at our <a href="events.html">events page</a> for more.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
    CodeWith carries the torch of CodeUp, set up by Claire Wicher in early 2015. The aim to provide free and friendly 
    adult coding tuition to adults who wanted it, and that is now CodeWith's aim too. We want somewhere everyone,
    from complete beginners to accomplished software engineers, can come together and share their enjoyment of coding.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years CodeUp spread to twenty different locations with multiple different organisers, and CodeWith is
    now consolidating that knowledge and experience into a single committee of organisers and mentors who run regular
    events. You can find out more about our committee and mentors on the <a href="people.html">people page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Committee</h3>
<p>
    We are run by a team of volunteers who have organised coding meetups for years.
