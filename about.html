<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p style="font-size: larger;">
  <strong>
    To create a space for adults to pursue programming-related learning and conversation, where everyone is
    valued, everyone has agency, and everyone is supported.
  </strong>
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  CodeWith carries the torch of CodeUp, set up by Claire Wicher in early 2015. The aim was to provide free and
  friendly coding tuition to adults who wanted it, and that is now CodeWith&apos;s aim too. We want somewhere everyone,
  from complete beginners to accomplished software engineers, can come together and share their enjoyment of coding.
</p>
<p>
  Over the years CodeUp spread to twenty different locations with multiple different organisers, and CodeWith has
  consolidated their knowledge and experience into a single committee of organisers and mentors who run regular
  events. You can find out more about our committee and mentors on the <a href="{{site.url}}/people">people page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Committee</h2>
<p>
  We are run by a team of volunteers who have organised coding meetups for years.
