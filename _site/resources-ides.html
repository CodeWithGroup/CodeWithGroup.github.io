                    Over the last 15 years, JetBrains has revolutionised the development industry with its intellisense,
                    refactoring and other tools, and a lot of their ideas have since been copied and pasted into other
                    programs. However, nothing beats the speed and efficiency of their development applications and
                    IntelliJ is fantastic for those wanting to work with Java, Scala, Angular, React and lots of other
                    modern languages.

                    Visual Studio is one of the titans of industry, having been around for over 20 years. Like Android
                    Studio it combines a wealth of professional development tools, the difference being that by default
                    it caters mainly to Microsoft technologies. Visual Studio provides support for desktop, mobile and
                    web applications as well as databases, games and office tools.

                    Despite sharing its big brother's name, Visual Studio Code is a tiny, nimble, stripped down code
                    editor designed specifically for people working on small projects in their own custom environments.
                    It's incredibly flexible and has loads of useful extensions.
