The various tools we use and events we host, including but not limited to the aforementioned GitHub, Slack, Discord, Eventbrite, and Google accounts, are collectively referred to as our "Services".

## Who's Who

When this Privacy Policy uses the term "Organiser" we mean any of our mentors and volunteers running, hosting, or helping out with our various events and workshops, or anyone with administrator-level access to the Services. Any parties consuming information from or interacting with tools and documents provided using our Services are referred 
to in these Terms collectively as "Users".

## Privacy Statement
This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that can be associated with or which relates to a person and/or could be used to identify a person ("Personal Data") that is collected from Users on or through the Services. We take the privacy of your Personal Data seriously. Because of that, we have created this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy as it includes important information regarding your Personal Data and other information.

"Non-Personal Data" as used in this Privacy Policy is therefore any information that does not relate to a person and/or cannot be used to identify a person. When you interact with the Services, we may collect Non-Personal Data. The limitations and requirements in this Privacy Policy on our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage/retention of Personal Data do not apply to Non-Personal Data.

The Organisers try to limit collection of Users' Personal Data, but a small amount of data is necessary to provide the community chat workspace/servers and events. These include:

* Names (partial or full): These are voluntarily provided for use on Slack and Discord.
* Email addresses: These are required by Eventbrite to allocate tickets through their services.
* Facebook profile link: This may be provided by using the Facebook Messenger button on the web site.
* Any other information that Users choose to provide and/or that enables Users to be personally identified.

## How We Use Your Personal Data
We collect and use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy, and applicable privacy laws. We may use the Personal Data as follows:
### For Specific Reasons
If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the purpose for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.

### Access and Use
If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to or use of the Services or functionality.
### Internal Business Purposes
We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes, including without limitation, to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our Users, to improve the Services, to protect against, identify or address wrongdoing, and to generally manage the Services and our community.
### Organiser Emails
We allow Organisers to use our email tools to contact Users for current and past events, so you may receive emails originating with Organisers. If you registered for an event on the Services, your email address is available to the Organisers. However, Organisers may also import the email addresses they have from external sources and send communications through the Services to those email addresses.
### Use of Interest-Based Data

We encourage Users to fill in forms from time to time, and there may be occasions on which an Organiser requests that the form only be filled in once. In this case, a User's Google Account details may be collected.
### Other Purposes
If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.
## Data Disclosure And Transfer
We will never disclose, transfer, share, sell, or otherwise give your Personal Data to third parties without further notice to and agreement by you.
### Social Media and Other Third Party Connections
In "Liking" or "Following" CodeWith on Social Media, including but not limited to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn (to the extent we provide that capability), we may collect some information from you including your name, email address, and any comments or content you post relevant to us. We likewise may collect your information if you submit information to us through social media sites.

#### Facebook Plug-Ins and Links on Our Pages
CodeWith's own website contains a widget which connects Users to us through Facebook Messenger. When you interact with this feature, your browser will establish a direct link with the Facebook servers, and Facebook will receive information about your browser and activity, and may link it to your Facebook user account. For more information about how Facebook uses data, please see Facebook's own policies (linked above).

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law in order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to
comply with a legal obligation, 
protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, 
prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services, 
act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users of the Services or the public, or 
protect against legal liability.

### How We Store Your Personal Data
We may store Personal Data itself or such information may be stored by third parties to whom we have transferred it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data collected via the Services from loss, misuse, unauthorised use, access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no network, server, database or Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us electronically. Please keep this  in mind when disclosing any Personal Data.

## How You Can Access, Update, Correct, or Delete Your Personal Data
You can request a copy of any and all Personal Data stored by Organisers at any time by emailing us at contact@codewith.org.uk and we will endeavour to provide said information in a reasonable time.However, if that Personal Data is stored by another company as a result of your use of our Services its deletion may be beyond our abilities and/or control and you may have to request deletion by contacting the third party that runs said service. For example, we may not be able to remove your email address from Eventbrite ourselves and it would be the responsibility of the User to contact Eventbrite and request removal of the Personal Data in accordance with their policies.

## Exclusions
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data that you provide to another User or visitor through the Services or through any other means, including to Organisers on event pages or information posted by you to any public areas of the Services.
