<h2>Before the event</h2>
<p>
    There are lots of ways to join us, but the most reliable method is to use a
    ‘proper’ computer or laptop, and log into Discord in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
    Safari does <b>not</b> work.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to join using your mobile phone or tablet (e.g. iPad), but be aware that you may
    be missing the chat functionality and you may not be able to participate in any of the
    interactive parts of the session. Again, if using an iPad please make sure you have a browser
    other than Safari.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t worry, you won’t need to install anything! The webinar will be hosted on the University
    of Reading’s Microsoft Teams software. You simply follow the link in the email which will open
    up in a web browser.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
    When you follow the link, you should see the following message. If you don’t have Teams
    installed, we recommend you join on the web. Click the button shown:
</p>

<p>
    Your browser might ask if Teams can use your camera and microphone. Click <b>Allow</b> – don’t
    worry, you can turn them off whenever you like. Turning this on will allow you to ask questions
    using your microphone during intervals.
</p>



<img class="signup img-fluid" src="./Content/allow-mic-camera.png">




<p>
    You should then be taken to a page which looks like below. Please <b>enter your name</b>, and
    turn <b>off</b> your <b>webcam</b> and <b>microphone</b>. This is very important! You should
    keep your camera and microphone muted throughout the session. When you've done all that, click
    ‘Join Now’.
</p>

<p>
    Please do not try to join the webinar using ‘Phone audio’ shown below. This option provides a
    telephone number to ring. However, the system is disruptive to the webinar, so phone audio
    participants cannot be accepted into the room.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, make sure you still have your <b>webcam</b> and <b>microphone</b> muted. You can also
    click on the <b>Meeting Chat</b> button to enable text chat. You can use this to ask questions
    throughout the session. The presenter may answer during the lecture, or one of our instructor
    team may respond in the Meeting Chat.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h4>I can't hear anything!?!</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Make sure your speakers/headphones are plugged in/turned on. Make sure your system
        volume is turned up.
    </li>
    <li>
        We are also aware of issues using Apple’s Safari browser. If you use it, you won’t be
        able to hear! Install Google Chrome instead or, if all else fails, install the
        Microsoft Teams app. Both are available for free!
    </li>
    <li>
        Did you select the Phone audio option (below) when you entered the room? If so, you
        won’t hear anything! Close the window and re-enter without this selected.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>I can't see the text chat!?!</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are using teams via Google Chrome (which is our recommended method), move
        the mouse over the main screen and this menu should appear. Click the little speech
        bubble button (circled) and the chat window will pop out at the side.
    </li>
</ul>


<img class="signup img-fluid" src="./Content/speech-bubble.jpg">



<ul>
    <li>
        If the chat button is not live or it's saying you're not a member of the team, this
        can usually be resolved by leaving and re-joining the session. If you're viewing us
        using a browser, this can be achieved by closing the browser and logging in again.
    </li>
</ul>



<ul>
    <li>
        If you are using teams on a mobile device or the teams app, some attendees will not be
        able to gain access to the chat and will get an error message. If this happens, we
        recommend you join using a laptop or desktop computer and log in using Google Chrome.
        When the link opens in Chrome, click the ‘Join on the web instead’ button.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>I keep getting refused access into the room!?!</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Have you tried entering using the option below or by dialling a phone number? If so, we
        won't be able to let you into the room! Try signing in using the standard method we have
        suggested instead (Google Chrome on a ‘proper’ computer).
    </li>
</ul>
