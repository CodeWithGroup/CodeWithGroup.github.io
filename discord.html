<h2>Before the event</h2>
<p>
    There are lots of ways to join us, but the most reliable method is to use a
    ‘proper’ computer or laptop, and log into Discord in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
    Safari does <b>not</b> work.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to join using your mobile phone or tablet (e.g. iPad), but be aware that you may
    be missing the chat functionality and you may not be able to participate in any of the
    interactive parts of the session. Again, if using an iPad please make sure you have a browser
    other than Safari.
</p>
<p>
    Some workshops include "code-alongs" where you need to use a 'proper' computer to be able to access the session. If
    you are not sure, feel free to contact the organisers via the <a href="{{site.url}}\contact">contact us</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t worry, you won’t need to install anything! The webinar will be hosted on CodeWith's Discord server. You simply
    follow the link in the email which will open
    up in a web browser.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>When you follow the invite link, you should see the following message.</p>


<img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="../images/discord-signup.png">

<p>
    You can either use the Discord app or, if you don’t have Discord
    installed, we recommend you join on the web. Click the button shown:
</p>

<img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="../images/discord-web.png">

<p>
    You can then sign up or log into an existing account.
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="discord-cols col-m-12 col-l-6">
        <h3>Register</h3><img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="../images/discord-create.png">

    <div class="discord-cols col-m-12 col-l-6">
        <h3>Log in</h3><img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="../images/discord-login.png">
    </div>
</div>


<p>Once you are logged in (either by signing up or using an existing account) you can select a channel by clicking on
    it's name on the left of the screen. </p>

<p>
    Your browser might ask if Discord can use your microphone. Click <b>Allow</b> – don’t
    worry, you can turn them off whenever you like. Turning this on will allow you to ask questions
    using your microphone during intervals.
</p>
<img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="../images/discord-microphone.png">
<p>
    If you would like to use your webcam on Discord, select the video button. It will open another digalog box. Click
    <b>Allow</b> – don’t
    worry, you can turn them off whenever you like.
</p>

<p>
    Your name should appear underneath the channel name. Clicking the name a second time will show the other people in
    the channel. it will look something like this:</p>

    <!--TODO image of channel with cameras-->
<p>
    Turn <b>off</b> your <b>microphone</b>. This is very important! You should
    keep your microphone muted throughout the session. When you've done all that, click
</p>


<!--TODO MUTE MICROPHONE BUTTON-->

<img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="./Content/other-join-options.png">


<p>
    Finally, make sure you still have your <b>webcam</b> and <b>microphone</b> muted. You can also
    click on the <b>Meeting Chat</b> button to enable text chat. You can use this to ask questions
    throughout the session. The presenter may answer during the lecture, or one of our instructor
    team may respond in the Meeting Chat.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h4>I can't hear anything!?!</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Make sure your speakers/headphones are plugged in/turned on. Make sure your system
        volume is turned up.
    </li>
    <li>
        We are also aware of issues using Apple’s Safari browser. If you use it, you won’t be
        able to hear! Install Google Chrome instead or, if all else fails, install the
        Discord app. Both are available for free!
    </li>
    <li>
        Did you select the Phone audio option (below) when you entered the room? If so, you
        won’t hear anything! Close the window and re-enter without this selected.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>I can't see the text chat!?!</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are using Discord via Google Chrome (which is our recommended method), move
        the mouse over the main screen and this menu should appear. Click the little speech
        bubble button (circled) and the chat window will pop out at the side.
    </li>
</ul>


<img class="discord-image mg-fluid" src="./Content/speech-bubble.jpg">



<ul>
    <li>
        If the chat button is not live or it's saying you're not a member of the team, this
        can usually be resolved by leaving and re-joining the session. If you're viewing us
        using a browser, this can be achieved by closing the browser and logging in again.
    </li>
</ul>



<ul>
    <li>
        If you are using Discord on a mobile device or the Discord app, some attendees will not be
        able to gain access to the chat and will get an error message. If this happens, we
        recommend you join using a laptop or desktop computer and log in using Google Chrome.
        When the link opens in Chrome, click the ‘Join on the web instead’ button.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>I keep getting refused access into the room!?!</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Have you tried entering using the option below or by dialling a phone number? If so, we
        won't be able to let you into the room! Try signing in using the standard method we have
        suggested instead (Google Chrome on a ‘proper’ computer).
    </li>
</ul>
